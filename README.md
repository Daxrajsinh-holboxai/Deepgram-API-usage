# A Simple Python script to check the API usage of Deepgram (i.e, No. of requests made)

## Setup

### 1. Create V-env.
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Create .env with these fields: (remember, do NOT forget to add the PROJECT_ID associated to the same account)
```bash
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=
DEEPGRAM_PROJECT_ID=
```

### 3. Run the script (as per your requirement)
```bash
python test.py/test2.py/test3.py
```

Thanks :)
